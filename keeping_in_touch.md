This is the Carpentries webpage (graciously hosted on the SI Data Science Lab website). You can read about our mission, see who is on our Instructor Team and see links to past workshops.

Direct email
------------

We have a general resource email address for Carpentries-related questions: SI-DataScience@si.edu, or feel free to email any of the instructors or helpers directly.

Carpentries-Announce Listserv

Carpentries-Alumni Slack Channel
--------------------------------

Slack is a message board/chat system.

1. Sign up for the Smithsonian Slack. If you already are a part of the Smithsonian Slack workspace, skip to Step #3. Go to https://smithsonian.slack.com/signup, and enter your SI email account (must be @si.edu).
2. You will get an email from Slack, and click Confirm Email. This link will send you to a page where you will fill in your name, and set a password. After doing this, you will be logged into Slack and prompted to "Explore Slack". I recommend go through this tour if you are unfamiliar with the system.
3. You will automatically be "added" to the #general and #random "channels". These channels appear at the top of the list of all channels on the left side, and all others are greyed-out. Click on the greyed-out #carpentries-alumni, and then click the "Join Channel" button in the main window. If you do not see #carpentries-alumni as an option, click "+ Add a channel" below the list of channels. Search for carpentries-alumni, then click on the link to go to the channel. At the bottom of the screen, click the "Join Channel" button to join the channel.

Monthly Carpentries Brown Bag
-----------------------------

The Carpentries Brown Bags are a series of monthly lunchtime gatherings for Smithsonian-affiliated staff, fellows, interns, contractors, etc. to discuss topics relating to Smithsonian Data or Software Carpentry workshop content.

We are hoping that these Brown Bags will enable us to continue the learning we started in our two-day workshops, while fostering a community of workshop "alumni" who can collaborate and support one another in our data and coding endeavors. (That said, if you are an SI-affiliated individual but you have not had a chance to participate in a workshop, you are still welcome to attend these Brown Bags!)

The Brown Bags will generally be held on the fourth Thursday of every month from 12pm--1pm EST. On occasion, Brown Bags may be moved due to holidays; please check the detailed schedule for the exact dates.

Schedule: https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/carpentries-brown-bag/wiki/Schedule

Join the SI Carpentries Instructor Team
---------------------------------------

In the Fall we will be looking for Smithsonian staff and fellows to be trained to join our team of instructors. No prior teaching experience is necessary, but "alumni" of the Carpentries workshops would make great candidates. Stay tuned!
